	<comment>osalet is a small annotation package inspired from Fraclet to help building 
	OSA simulation components based on the Fractal/Julia component framework. Indeed, an OSA
	simulation component is a regular Fractal component with an added simulation controller
	that provides teh API to the business part of the component. This simulation also to be
	connected to other simulation components in order to synchronize the scheduling of events.
	This synchronization is normally handled by a dedicated component called a &quot;SuperScheduler&quot;.
	What osalet does is to auto-magically insert and connect the superscheduler components 
	altogether. This is done by inserting automatically a fraclet annotation in the component. NO_M2ECLIPSE_SUPPORT: Project files created with the maven-eclipse-plugin are not supported in M2Eclipse.</comment>
