# OSA SimAPIs module

## What's OSA?

OSA stands for Open Simulation Architecture.

OSA is primarily intended to be a federating platform for the simulation community: it is designed to favour the integration of new or existing contributions at every level of its architecture.

The platform core supports discrete-event simulation engine(s) built on top of the ObjectWeb Consortiumâ€™s Fractal component model: In OSA, the systems to be simulated are modeled and instrumented using Fractal components.

Fractal components offer many advanced and original features, such as multi-programming language support and the ability to share sub-components. In OSA, the event handling is mostly hidden in the controller part of the components, which alleviates noticeably the modeling process, but also ease the replacement of any part of the simulation engine.

Apart the simulation engine, OSA aims at integrating useful tools for modeling, developing, experimenting and analysing simulations.

## OSA Project Modules

OSA is composed of multiples, possibly many, maven sub-projects. However to allow better flexibility, these projects are structurd following a flat structure.

## About this module

This module is the core of the OSA API. 
	
The new design of this API provides a better separation of th simulation and modeling aspects.
It also abstracts the type used in the time values using generics such that time can be coded 
using various types like integer or floats. This abstraction still needs further testing and 
improvements.
